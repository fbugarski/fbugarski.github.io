    <h1>CONSULTING SERVICES</h1>
    <h3>Blockchain Feasibility</h3>
    <p>Initial Project Evaluation Blockchain is still a young technology with many implementations which did not provide expected value due to lack of strategic approach and evaluation. For that reason, our consulting services start with an assessment to determine if there are a potential value and feasibility that justifies an investment in blockchain solution. In this process detail understanding of the projects is acquired as the ground for the selection of blockchain technologies, architecture and frameworks that are most adequate to create estimated value and your business requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Blockchain Architecture</h3>
    <p>Public and Private Blockchain
    Once blockchain is evaluated as a feasible technology for particular use-case, design of Blockchain architecture is the key for successful integration of the solution. Depending on business requirements, blockchain network can be open and public or private and only accessible to people who are given permission to use it. Blockchain architecture includes designing private and public networks, as well as transactions logic including smart contracts that's used to calculate fee for participants.

    <h3>Confidential Computing Design and Implementation</h3>
    <p>Privacy-Preserving Computation
    Preserving user's privacy is one of the main challenges of modern cloud-based computing. Ultraviolet Consult provides consulting services from design, conceptual solution, over PoC development to the final product. Confidential computing faces problems of storing, moving, and processing data in a secure way. Protecting data usually comes at the cost of performance and designing solutions requires a deep analysis of the particular use-case to evaluate security risks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>End-To-End Data Protection</h3>
    <p>End-To-End privacy, integrity and authenticity of your data
    When talking about end-to-end data protection, it's usually implied that it's about protecting data in transit. Ultraviolet Consult team provide consulting services around the state of the art technologies for protecting data in motion. Alongside with protecting data in motion, we are also working on the development of the cutting edge methods for protecting data in use, allowing user to manipulate data securely and execute computation on data without need to ever encrypt it.
