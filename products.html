                    <h2>FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION & SECURE MULTI-PARTY COMPUTATION</h2>
                        <p>Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is one of the most important advances in theoretical computer science in the 21st century so far. It is a form of encryption allowing computation on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. The result of these computations is also encrypted. Expansion of cloud computing exposed sensitive data to new security vulnerabilities creating practically unlimited number of use-cases for this form of encryption.
                            Ultraviolet Consult team is working on this cutting-edge technology making us one of the pioneers and early-adopters of possibly the most advanced cryptography algorithms to the date.</p>

                    <h2>PRIVACY-PRESERVING AI & ML ORCHESTRATION</h2>
                        <p>AI and its disciplines such as machine learning and deep learning usually rely on models with parameters that are tuned in the process of learning using training, test, and validation datasets. Often, these datasets contain sensitive information that needs to be protected. FHE and blockchain are technologies that can be utilized to achieve privacy at the same time allowing data to be processed by the AI algorithms.
                            With experience in both blockchain and FHE, Ultraviolet Consult team is ready to face privacy-preserving as one of the crucial challenges of modern computer science.</p>
